							<p>During the 2014 and 2015, I reserched methods on minimizing the surface reflectivity of Gallium Nitritde.
								I presented my work at various local and international science fairs, and was ultimatly one of 17 
								finalists in the 2015 Google International Scince Fair for the americas region. The summeery video above
								was aprt of my submitiion. Below, you can find the paper final version of the paper that was submitted to
								 the intel/Siemins science fair in 2016.</p>

							<h3>Abstract</h3>
							<p>Solar panels are most efficient when they reflect the least light. This is often
								accomplished with an antireflective surface. The goal of this project is to understand how various
								3D nanostructures can be imparted on gallium nitride (GaN) surfaces by photoelectrochemical
								etching to determine the least reflective surface. In this experiment, GaN was used because of its
								durability and stability, both physically and chemically. Although types of silicon and gallium
								arsenide semiconductors are often used, GaN is potentially more cost effective and less pollutive
								for use in harsh climates including orbiting satellites. The surface structures of GaN wafers were
								modified using a wet chemical etching process which included either 0.3 M nitric acid or tribasic
								phosphate. The wafers were also simultaneously treated with both UV light and either 2.0 or 3.0
								Volts. The reflectivity of the surface structure was dependent on both the etchant and the voltage.
								The results show that nitric acid combined with 3.0 V produced the lowest reflectivity which was
								was comparable to etched silicon. These results indicate GaN is a potential alternative material
								for certain solar applications.</p>
